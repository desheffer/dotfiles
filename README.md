# dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles for various Unix utilities.  If you find these
files useful, then you are free to use them however you see fit.

## Installation

Run `bootstrap.sh` to link the files into your home directory.

To use special symbols, download and install one of the patched [Nerd
Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) for your terminal.
